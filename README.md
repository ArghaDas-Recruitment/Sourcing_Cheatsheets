Boolean Search Cheatsheet For Various Roles

Generic search string to find BI Developers
Here’s an example search string that looks for resumes:

(intitle:resume OR inurl:resume) “bi developer”

You can expand your search by looking for words similar to “resume” (e.g. “cv”) and words often found in resumes (e.g. “work history.”) Also, exclude irrelevant results that come up with the NOT (-) operator. Here’s an example of an expanded search string:

(intitle:resume OR inurl:resume OR inurl:cv) “bi developer” -job -jobs -sample

Searching for BI Developer profiles
BI Developers who are active in various social platforms may often indicate their profession. Look through social networks using the site: operator and terms found exclusively on member profiles. For example:

site:quora.com "bi developer" "credentials & highlights"
site:github.com “bi developer” “contribution activity”
site:meetup.com “bi developer” “member since”

Add more criteria in your search (like location) to look for profiles that better match your requirements.
